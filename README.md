Fun with loops!

Part 1: Research
* Search the internet OR come up with an idea to build a 2 to 3 cool patterns for looping LED Lights.
* I've given one idea, BlinkN in my Lab-008 example code.

Part 2: Implement your Loops
* Implement for loops modeled after my BlinkN loop, but that does something different.
    * Alters the colors
    * Alters the timing
    * Rotates through multiple colors, etc.

Part 3: Demo your Loops to the class

Part 4: Turn in via GitHub Pull request as usual.
